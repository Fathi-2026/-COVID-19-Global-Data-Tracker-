# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📌 Project Description

A data analysis project that visualizes the spread and impact of COVID-19 across selected countries (India, Kenya, and the United States) using global datasets. This project helps track the evolution of total cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze and visualize the progression of COVID-19 cases.
* Compare COVID-19 trends across countries.
* Provide insights on global vaccination efforts.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `covid_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter.
3. Run all the cells in order. Ensure the dataset (usually `owid-covid-data.csv`) is placed in the same directory.

## 💡 Insights

* The United States had the highest total case count among the selected countries.
* Kenya experienced a slower but steady rise in both cases and deaths.
* India showed rapid early growth and a significant vaccination curve.

## 📎 Reflections

This project enhanced our understanding of data wrangling and visualization in real-world datasets. It also underscored the importance of data transparency and public health reporting.
